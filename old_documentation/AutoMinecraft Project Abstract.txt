Minecraft is a wildly popular video game that appeals to a diverse age group, with an audience predominantly of high school and college age. Particularly for college-aged adults, finding spare time for hobbies like video games can be challenging. Minecraft requires significant time investment for gathering resources, building bases, and crafting equipment to strengthen the player for defeating the Ender Dragon. This resource gathering process can be quite tedious, which isn’t ideal for a hobby activity. AutoMinecraft is an autonomous bot (a computer program acting as a player) that performs various in-game tasks such as traveling, building, mining, and combat based on the user’s text commands. Users input text commands to the in-game chat box, which determines the bot's automated actions via a mod (a custom program that alters the game's code). Based on this input, the bot takes the user’s commands to set a goal, and break it down into small executable steps. Using additional mods, the bot program will save information about its assigned task after the game is closed and reopened. This saved data ensures the bot remembers its progress for quickly resuming tasks in future game sessions. Due to its automation, it can run in the background, performing tasks without the user's direct engagement with the game. AutoMinecraft can greatly reduce the busy-work and time users need to invest for achieving in-game milestones, being able to handle monotonous resource gathering, such as crop farming and ore mining. This accelerates progress toward game completion and allows the user to focus on more fun, meaningful tasks, like building and exploring.
