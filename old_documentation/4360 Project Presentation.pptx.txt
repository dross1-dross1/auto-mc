Project Description
Scope
High Level Deliverables
9/16/2023: Git repository containing project files (API, Java code, etc.)
9/22/2023: Host an LLM inference API locally
10/6/2023: Set up an environment for the agent in-game, via a mod loader like Fabric
11/3/2023: Interact with the in-game environment via code 
11/24/2023: Control an agent solely using natural language

Project Name
Primary focus on training an autonomous agent for Minecraft Java Edition. 
Excludes creating a generalized AI to complete any task in any game. 
Not about surpassing the best human agents, but rather showing the possibility of giving human-like commands to an AI and having it be carried out successfully.

The main goal of this project is to create a Minecraft Java Edition bot that can perform actions based on instructions given in a natural language. What we intend to achieve is combining the adaptivity of a reinforcement learning model with the rationality and long-term planning of AutoGPT.
Technical Requirements 
Python 3.11.5
Java 17.0.8
AutoGPT 0.4.7
Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.1
Fabric Mod Loader 0.14.22

Project Epics
User Stories
Project Name
AI project includes natural language prompts as user stories where applicable
User is able to verify the AI can read game data/ information
User can enter natural language prompts to give tasks to the AI
“Gather wood from nearby” or “Craft 8 torches”
“Gather all necessary materials to build a nether portal and travel to the nether” or “Build a house out of gold blocks”
User is be able to see ChatGPT's summary plan for a complex command, they shouldn't have to spell out the microsteps
AI is able to ask clarifying questions in the event that the user provides ambiguous prompts (eg. "I don't want to die")

Have the AI interact with the game via LLM inference API
Have an interface for the user to control the agent directly in-game (via text)
Have the AI perform a simple task
Have the AI accomplish a complex task through many simple steps
Have the AI maintain persistent world-awareness (eg. knows the exact contents of a chest previously opened)
